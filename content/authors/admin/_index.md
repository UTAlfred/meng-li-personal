I am currently a tenure-track assistant professor jointly affiliated with Institute for Artificial Intelligence and School of Integrated Circuits in Peking University. Before joining Peking University, I was a staff research scientist and tech lead in Meta On-Device AI team with a focus on researching and productizing efficient AI algorithms and hardwares for next generation AR/VR devices. I received my Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of [Prof. David Z. Pan](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) and my bachelor degree in Peking University under the supervision of [Prof. Ru Huang](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1498/6685.htm) and [Prof. Runsheng Wang](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/info/1498/6670.htm).

My research interests focus on efficient and secure multi-modality AI acceleration algorithms and hardwares. 

_I am always looking for creative and self-motivated students and post docs who are interested in co-designing the future AI acceleration system. Please contact me via [email](meng.li@pku.edu.cn) with the subject line "Perspective Student from [Your Institute]" and your CV._
