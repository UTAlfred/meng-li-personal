title: One Paper Accepted by ASSCC'2025
subtitle: One paper on efficient embodied AI is accepted by ASSCC'2025 as regular papers. In the paper, we designed and taped out a 28nm 534.6TOPS/W edge accelerator for embodied AI using stochastic computing, which supported mixed precision and sparsity.

#subtitle: Seven papers on efficient and privacy-preserving deep learning are accepted by ICCAD'2024 as regular papers, including "OSCA&#58; End-to-end Serial Stochastic Computing Neural Acceleration with Fine-grained Scaling and Piecewise Activation", "HG-PIPE&#58; Vision Transformer Acceleration with Hybrid-Grained Pipeline", "ProPD&#58; Dynamic Token Tree Pruning and Generation for LLM Parallel Decoding", "AdapMoE&#58; Adaptive Sensitivity-based Expert Gating and Management for Efficient MoE Inference", "MCUBERT&#58; Memory-Efficient BERT Inference on Commodity Microcontrollers", "PrivQuant&#58; Communication-Efficient Private Inference with Quantized Network/Protocol Co-Optimization", and "FlexHE&#58; A flexible Kernel Generation Framework for Homomorphic Encryption-Based Private Inference".
